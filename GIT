1.Define Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development.Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

why git is used?
Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
Offline Work: Developers can work offline and commit changes locally without a network connection.
Redundancy: Every user has a complete copy of the repository, reducing the risk of data loss.

What is a conflict in Git?
A conflict in Git occurs when two branches have made edits to the same line in a file or when one branch deletes a file while the other branch modifies it. Git cannot automatically resolve these changes; the developer must manually resolve the conflicts.

2.what is Version control System?
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

3.what is github?
GitHub is a web-based platform and service that provides hosting for software development projects that use the Git version control system. It offers a wide range of features to facilitate collaboration among developers, project management, code review, and continuous integration.

4.what is git Repository?
A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories.

5.Git working Process?
1.initialize git repository
2.Adding files
3.Commiting Changes
4.Check the Status using their appriopiate commands.

6.what is .git folder?
.git is a hidden directory in a Git repository that stores all the metadata, configuration, and object database needed for version control. It enables Git to track changes, manage branches, and maintain the history of the project.

7.what happens you delete .git?
History: All commit history will be lost
Branches: Information about branches will be lost.

8.diff between git fetch and push?
Purpose: git fetch updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository.
Purpose: git push uploads your local commits to a remote repository.

9.what is .gigitnore?
 gitignore file is used in a git repository to ignore the files and directories which are unnecessary to project this will be ignored by the git once the changes as been committed to the Remote repository.

Repository:
A repository (repo) is a directory that contains your project's files and the entire history of changes made to those files, managed by Git.

Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID (SHA-1 hash) and records changes along with a commit message.

Branch:
A branch is a parallel version of the repository, allowing you to work on different lines of development. The default branch is usually called main or master.

Push:
Pushing is the process of sending your committed changes to a remote repository, updating it with your latest work.

Pull:
Pulling is the process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.

Merge:
Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch, integrating the work done separately.

Rebase:
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit, creating a linear history.

Initialization and Setup
Initialize Repository:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
Clone Repository:

git clone <repository>: Creates a copy of an existing repository into a new directory.
Configuration:

git config --global user.name "name": Sets the username for all repositories on the system.
git config --global user.email "email": Sets the email for all repositories on the system.

Conflict: A situation where Git cannot automatically merge changes and requires manual resolution.

How do you change the last commit?
Use `git commit --amend` to modify the most recent commit. This can change the commit's message or include new changes.

How do you list all the remote repositories configured?
Use `git remote -v` to list all the remote repositories configured for your local repository.
